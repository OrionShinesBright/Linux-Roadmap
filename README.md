# Linux-Roadmap
A detailed, and precise roadmap for the linux desktop in 2025

> [!CAUTION]
> This was written and finalized on 4th July, 2025. The linux community is fast. _**If something is not working, it is likely that this page might be out of date**_.. In such a case, let me know in the `Discussions` tab or at pillars.of.creation.880333@gmail.com.

## What to Expect
  The first thing to know is that the Linux community is not backed by money like Microsoft or Apple. Most of the code that runs a Linux environment is contributed by hobbyists in their free time, for free, with no incentive to pump out more features, other than their own love for open source software. Therefore, **DO NOT expect a Windows/MacOS like experience**. Linux is not Windows. Do not think of it as such. That will save you from many troubles later on.
But that does not mean that a Linux based environment is worse or whatever. Not at all. The major difference is that in a lot of cases, you, the user, are expected to fix issues by yourself (there *is* very good and comprehensive help available though, and I *will* point you in it's direction throughout the guide).

## How to follow this Guide
I will suggest that you do as follows:
1. _**MAKE BACKUPS OF ALL YOUR IMPORTANT DATA OF YOUR DEVICE ON EXTERNAL DISKS OR THE CLOUD BEFORE YOU BEGIN**_.
2. Try things out on a virtual machine before you try it for real.
3. Go through the guide in the order in which it is written. At certain points, you will have to make choices based on your own wishes - I recommend that if you are a beginner, then you should stick with the recommended choices.
4. Look out for sections titled `NOTE/TIP/CAUTION/WARNING`:
  - `TIP` is just informational stuff, but not vital to the guide.
  - `NOTE` is for clarifications.
  - `CAUTION` is like a soft disclaimer.
  - `WARNING` _should_ be heeded if you want no problems.
5. I shall put images and videos to help you visualize stuff.

## BEST OF LUCK (NO NEED TO STRESS :D)
This link will take you to part 1 of the guide: [PART 1](Parts/Part_1.md) (points to archlinux.org for now. Need time to edit more).
